# Heart Data Analysis Project
This project aims to analyze heart-related data to explore the impact of statin medication on various cardiac parameters. The dataset, sourced from an Excel file, undergoes preprocessing steps including data cleaning, removal of irrelevant columns, and handling missing values. Exploratory data analysis techniques such as boxplots, histograms, and correlation analysis are employed to gain insights into the dataset.

Statistical tests are conducted to assess the significance of differences in cardiac parameters between groups based on statin intake. Logistic regression is then employed to investigate the relationship between statin intake and cardiac health indicators.
